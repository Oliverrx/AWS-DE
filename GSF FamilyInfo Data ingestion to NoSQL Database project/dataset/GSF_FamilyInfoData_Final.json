Pang actually asked if we can give her 4000 RMB per year to support her study in a vocational school in Xi'an as we dIDfor Pang Juanjuan.Yang Yuhui is not as determined as Pang Juanjuan to finish vocational school education. She is always on the edge of dropping out even from middle school. I am not sure if it's just because of family reasons or she has no interest in study either. I don't think it is economic reasons because there is not much economic cost. Her family is complicated. Her father has mental illness and she is taken cared by her grandpa who actually doesn't want her to leave the village because he wants her to take care of him when he is older. We will know more about her in the coming year and see how she is doing because she still needs to finish the M3 this year. 8/14\n",
